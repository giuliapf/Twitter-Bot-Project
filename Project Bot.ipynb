    "# Introduction\n",
    "1. The topic I chose to focus on was the notion of constructing a chatbot that can  access Twitter and determine keywords that are associated with hate speech. Nowadays, social media has become a way for multiple people to connect, becoming even more essential after the pandemic, which highlighted the need for human connection. Therefore, it is necessary that social media becomes a safe space for people to use without being targeted by slurs, hate speech, and other offensive words that create unsafe areas making communities uncomfortable. With the creation of this chatbot, I will be able to select words that are associated with this hazardous language and then assemble a way for the bot to send out a specific response that counters this type of discourse. Overall, my idea is to create a way for Twitter to become safer for people to use and go through the loopholes that may have been developed by some users as Twitter tried to oppose these tactics."

    "# Materials\n",
    "1. The methods that I used in this project are the Jupyter lab and Tweepy in order to assemble a bot that can access Twitter and pick out the different words of my choosing.\n",
    "2. I also used the DIGHUM101 notebooks, especially notebook 3.3, which focuses on Tweepy and how to set it up. \n",
    "3. Moreover, I will used resources like the Stanford Encyclopedia, which show examples of what hate speech encompasses. "

    "# Research\n",
    "1. To be able to find all the racial slurs that Twitter can't usually eradicate, I had to look through various websites that talked about how Twitter continued to have discriminatory language and displayed some instances. However, it was still challenging to locate words themselves because of the stigma behind them, so I scoured through academic pages to find examples and then used my code to see if they were present on Twitter.\n",
    "2. I also looked at examples of what to say when people use hate speech in order to discourage this type of activity. "

    "1. In conclusion, I realized that I cannot just code a bot that targets a bunch of words because sometimes these words are better explained according to the situation. The context is important when you think of a response because some people may be talking about their personal experience with hate speech or describing another one's actions. This means the bot doesn't need to answer at this moment. At the same time, as the programmer, I sometimes don't have knowledge of the group being attacked, and I would need to inform myself before answering a specific tweet, not generating a generic response. I need to broaden my code in the future to locate these words precisely and make sure that they mean what they mean (like some words may mean another thing in another language), as well as being able to sort the tweets and replies in a more organized fashion.  \n",
    "2. Overall, I learned a lot about using Tweepy and gained more insight into how Twitter has specific developer programs that may help me expand my research. I feel a lot more confident in using python, especially being a beginner, after experimenting with it and seeing what makes certain things work. "
